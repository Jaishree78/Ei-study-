# ðŸŽ¯ Design Patterns and Mini Project

This repository contains my solutions for **two exercises**:
1. **Exercise 1:** Six different design pattern use cases
2. **Exercise 2:** Mini Project â€“ Satellite Command System

---

## ðŸ“Œ Exercise 1 â€“ 6 Design Pattern Use Cases

| Pattern Type  | Pattern    | Use Case Example |
|---------------|------------|------------------|
| Behavioral    | Observer   | Astronaut Task Conflict Notification |
| Behavioral    | Strategy   | Task Sorting / Payment Method Switching |
| Creational    | Singleton  | Mission Control as a single instance |
| Creational    | Factory    | Creating astronaut roles dynamically |
| Structural    | Adapter    | Integrating legacy task format |
| Structural    | Decorator  | Adding reminders/logging to tasks |

ðŸ‘‰ See [`Exercise-1/`](Exercise-1) for code, problem statements, and sample outputs.

## ðŸ“Œ Exercise 2 â€“ Satellite Command System

A console-based simulation of controlling a satellite in orbit.  
Implements **Command, Factory, Observer, Decorator, Singleton-style config**.

ðŸ‘‰ See [`Exercise2-satellite-command-system/`](exercise2-satellite-command-system) for full implementation.
